\begin{problem}{Arithmetic Sequence }{standard input}{standard output}{1 second}{256 megabytes}

    A Sequence is a set of one or more things (usually numbers) that are in order. Each number in the sequence is called a term.

    In an Arithmetic Sequence the difference between one term and the next is a constant. In other words, we just add the same value each time ... infinitely.
    
    In General we could write an arithmetic sequence like this: ${a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, ... }$ where $a$ is the first term, and $d$ is the difference between the terms (called the \textsl{common difference})
    
    To sum up the terms of this arithmetic sequence: ${a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d) + ...}$ Use this formula: $S=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(a+kd)=\frac{2a+(n-1)d}{2}$
    
    Now you are given a number $S$, print an arithmetic sequence of \textbf{integers} whose sum is equal to $S$.

\InputFile

The test case only contains an integer $S(-2^{31}\le S \le 2^{31}-1)$, represents the sum of an arithmetic sequence.
% The test case only contains an integer $(-2^{31}\le S \le 2^{31}-1)$, represents the sum of an arithmetic sequence.

\OutputFile

An arithmetic sequence \textbf{of integers} whose sum is equal to $S$. Separate each number with a space.
