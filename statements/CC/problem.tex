\begin{problem}{Meticarith Sequence}{standard input}{standard output}{1 second}{256 megabytes}

    You ask what is a Meticarith Sequence? I don't know what is a Meticarith Sequence either.

    But we both know one thing about Meticarith Sequence. Denote the Meticarith Sequence by $x$, and let $n=|x|$(the length of $x$), we found $1\le x_i\le 100$ and $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x_i p^{i+1}\%m=Q$ ($\%$ is the modulo operator).
    
    Given $Q$, $p$ and $m$, now you know what a Meticarith Sequence is.
    
\InputFile
The test case only contains one line, three integer $Q,p,m(2\le Q,p,m \le 10^9)$.

It is guaranteed that $p$ and $m$ are coprime and Q is generated from  a sequence $x$ satisfies $1\le x_i\le 100$ and $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}x_i p^{i+1}\%m=Q$ .
\OutputFile
An Sequence \textbf{of integers} which is a Meticarith Sequence. Separate each number with a space.
